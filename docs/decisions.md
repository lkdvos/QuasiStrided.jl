# API and ownership decision record

Main process only. Record every public-interface decision and file ownership
change here before workers depend on it.

## Frozen interfaces

### `contract!` entry point (Phase 0)

```julia
contract!(C::StridedView, alpha::Number,
          A::StridedView, indA::NTuple{NA,Int},
          B::StridedView, indB::NTuple{NB,Int},
          beta::Number,
          indC::NTuple{NC,Int}) where {NA,NB,NC}
```

Label semantics: one `Int` label per axis, given in axis order for `indA`,
`indB`, `indC`. A label in both `indA` and `indB` but absent from `indC` is a
contracted (K) axis. A label in `indC` and in exactly one of `indA`/`indB` is
free (M if from A, N if from B). Diagonals (repeated label within one tensor's
own index tuple) and labels appearing in `indC` but not in `indA`/`indB` are
out of scope this milestone: raise `ArgumentError`. Matched labels across
tensors must have equal axis length: raise `DimensionMismatch` otherwise.

Rationale: mirrors the M/N/K `AxisGroup` construction directly
(`Julia-Tensor-Indexing-Agent-Spec.md` §3) and is a well-precedented labeled-
index convention (cf. TensorOperations.jl), while staying an explicit
axis-list front end per the handoff (no einsum string parsing).

### Namespace and package location

- Package: `QuasiStrided.jl`, module `QuasiStrided`, at
  `/mnt/home/ldevos/Projects/QuasiStrided.jl` (sibling to the Rust repo's
  local checkouts, matching this user's existing convention of
  `~/Projects/<Name>.jl`).
- Depends on `StridedViews` (installed locally, `~/Projects/StridedViews.jl`
  v0.5.1; registry has up to 0.5.2). Does not depend on `Strided` itself in
  `src/` for this milestone — nothing here needs `Strided`'s functionality
  (its blocked `mapreducedim!` machinery is explicitly out of scope); `Strided`
  is a `test`-only extra so integration tests can build `StridedView`s the
  way a real user would via `Strided.sview`/`StridedView` construction if
  useful.
- `StridedView` accessors used: `size(a)`, `strides(a)`, `offset(a)` (exported
  from `StridedViews`), `parent(a)` (Base). Verified against
  `~/Projects/StridedViews.jl/src/stridedview.jl` (repo HEAD
  922d6c6bf03d67fb5f093452c3d159d80e343738) and the installed package source
  under `~/.julia/packages/StridedViews/vC5J6/src/stridedview.jl:27-96`.
- SIMD dependency: `SIMD.jl` (v3.7.1 installed locally, providing `Vec{N,T}`).
  Chosen because it's already resolvable in the depot, is the direct
  `Vec{N,T}`-style abstraction the microkernel spec describes, and needs no
  extra setup. `VectorizationBase.jl` is also present but is a heavier,
  lower-level dependency of packages like LoopVectorization; not needed for
  one explicit-SIMD candidate.
- Reference machine for this bootstrap: Cascade Lake-class, AVX-512 (avx512f/
  dq/cd/bw/vl) + AVX2 + FMA, Julia 1.12.6.

## File ownership (updated at phase boundaries)

| File | Owner | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Project.toml`, `src/QuasiStrided.jl`, `test/runtests.jl`, this file, `STATUS.md` | main process | all |
| `src/axis_group.jl` | indexing implementer | 1 |
| `test/test_axis_group.jl` | oracle/test implementer | 1 |
| `test/strided_integration.jl` | oracle/test implementer | 1 |
| `src/tiles.jl` | packing implementer | 2 |
| `src/packing.jl` | packing implementer | 2 |
| `test/test_packing.jl` | packing implementer | 2 |
| `src/kernel.jl` | scalar implementer | 2 |
| `test/test_kernel.jl` | scalar implementer | 2 |
| `src/kernels/simd.jl` | SIMD implementer | 3 |
| `src/driver.jl` | driver implementer | 3 |
| `test/test_driver.jl` | driver implementer | 3 |
| `benchmark/*.jl` | respective implementer of the component benchmarked | 1-3 |
| `README.md` | main process (content from all phases) | 4 |

A worker needing to edit a file outside this table requests a transfer through
the main process; this table is updated first.

## Phase 1 integration note

`Project.toml`'s `[targets] test` was missing `Random` (needed by the
independent oracle/property tests, which use `Random.MersenneTwister` with a
fixed seed). Added by the main process post-integration: `Random` in
`[extras]` and `[targets] test`. No other cross-worker conflicts.
