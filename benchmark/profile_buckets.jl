# Bucketed cost-attribution helper for benchmark/profile_to_suite.jl.
# `include`d, not a module, consistent with benchmark/harness.jl.
#
# Parses `Profile.fetch()`'s raw backtrace data directly (rather than relying
# on `Profile.print`'s text output) so we can compute, per frame, which named
# cost bucket it belongs to and tally sample counts ourselves.

using Printf

# Bucket definitions per backend "family". Each entry is
# `(bucketname, [substring, ...])`; a frame matches a bucket if ANY of its
# substrings appears in either the frame's function name or file path
# (case-sensitive, as the source identifiers themselves are).
#
# Two tiers, checked in two separate passes over a whole sample's stack (see
# `_classify_backtrace`), NOT a single first-match-wins pass over one bucket
# list: `SPECIFIC_QS_BUCKETS` matches on function names (unambiguous: a
# frame named `pack_a!` is packing, wherever it lives), `FALLBACK_QS_BUCKETS`
# matches on file-path substrings (the `src/` stage folders: `"microkernels/"`,
# `"planning/"`, ...),
# used only if NO frame anywhere in the sample's stack matched a specific
# name. This two-pass split matters: a stack's leaf is very often a generic
# or third-party frame (an inlined `SIMD.jl` intrinsic, a `macro expansion`
# thunk, `Base.range`'s `iterate`) that itself matches nothing specific, and
# that leaf's *file* can be misleading -- e.g. a `macro expansion` frame
# inside `_store_tile_vector!`'s generated body lives in the same file
# (`src/microkernels/simd.jl`) as the FMA microkernel, so checking file
# substrings before walking further up the stack to the actual
# `_store_tile_vector!` frame would misclassify the whole sample as
# "microkernel" instead of "store". Running the specific-name pass across
# the ENTIRE stack first, before ever consulting a file-level fallback,
# avoids that: the walk keeps going past unmatched generic/third-party
# frames until it either finds a named function anywhere in the sample, or
# exhausts the stack and falls back to file-level matching.

`include_meta = true`) is NOT instruction-pointer data and must be stripped
first, or `Base.StackTraces.lookup` will resolve garbage frames from it.

Backtraces are stored leaf-first (the actively-executing frame comes first)
and each per-sample backtrace is terminated by a `0` sentinel. This function
splits on those sentinels and classifies each sample via `_classify_backtrace`
-- "nearest named ancestor, specific names preferred over file-level
fallbacks", not strict leaf-only self-time, and not inclusive/"Count"-column
semantics either: each sample still contributes to exactly one bucket, so
generic runtime/dispatch frames sitting between named layers cannot
spuriously dominate every bucket the way naive inclusive counting would.

Returns raw sample counts per bucket name (NOT yet normalized to
percentages); callers should divide by the sum of all bucket counts (not by
`length(data)`, which also counts sentinels) to get percentages that sum to
100%.
