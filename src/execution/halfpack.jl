"""
    UnpackedAView{S,C<:Axis}(storage::S, rowbase::Int, cols::C, nrows::Int)

Stands in for a packed A micro-panel when A is read in place: `nrows` logical
rows (the kernel's `mr`), unit-stride in storage, at `axis_length(cols)` K
steps. Logical row `i`, K step `p` lives at zero-based storage address
`rowbase + i + axis_offset(cols, p)` -- the address
[`_a_step_offset`](@ref) returns for it, which `_accumulate_step` hands
straight to `panel_vload`. So unlike a `PackedPanel`, whose `panel_vload`
offset is relative to the panel pointer, this view's offset IS the full
storage address; `rowbase` already includes the operand's own base offset.
`cols` may be affine or scattered (any `Axis`); only the row direction has to
be unit-stride, because that is what makes one `Vec{W,T}` load valid.

Borrowed, like `PackedPanel`: `cols` may be a `PtrScatterAxis` into a
workspace buffer, so the caller keeps that buffer alive. `length` is the
packed-equivalent element count `nrows * axis_length(cols)` -- what
`_execute_tile_prologue!` compares against `packed_a_length(kernel, kc)` --
and NOT the storage length. Not bounds-checked; see
[`execute_half_packed!`](@ref) for where the check is made.

"""
    execute_half_packed!(plan::ContractPlan, alpha::Number, beta::Number)

Unexported and opt-in: nothing in [`plan_contract`](@ref) or
[`contract!`](@ref) dispatches here. Same contract and result as
[`execute!`](@ref) on every plan; on an eligible one it skips packing A.

When [`_half_pack_a_eligible`](@ref) holds, the whole M extent is one full
`mr`-row register sliver whose rows are unit-stride in A's (dense) storage, so
each K step of A is already `mr` consecutive elements -- exactly what one
`_pack_a_contiguous!` step would copy into the packed panel. Instead of the
copy, the microkernel reads those elements in place through an
[`UnpackedAView`](@ref), which `_accumulate_step` addresses via
`_a_step_offset` (resolved on the view's type at compile time). B is packed
exactly as `execute!` packs it, and the loop nest is `execute!`'s with the
`ic` loop and the M-sliver loop each fixed at one iteration: `jc` over N in
`nc` blocks, `pc` over K in `kc` panels, then every N-sliver's micro-tile
against the one A view. K may be scattered; B and C may have any layout.

On any ineligible plan, and for the empty-output and `Qk == 0 || alpha == 0`
short-circuits, this is exactly `execute!(plan, alpha, beta)`. The function is
therefore always safe to call: it is never wrong, only sometimes no faster.

Per K step the arithmetic is `execute!`'s: the same `_accumulate_step`, FMA
order, K blocking and store, on the same A values read from a different
address. Results are therefore bitwise identical to `execute!`'s (and to
`execute_tilewise!`'s) in the eligible case -- observed so in
test/execution/test_halfpack.jl, which compares with `==`.

Bounds: as in `execute!`, storage bounds are validated once per block with
[`checked_span_bounds`](@ref) -- C once per `jc` block, B and A once per
`(jc, pc)` panel -- before any read or write, and the tile calls inside go
through `unsafe_pack_b!`/`unsafe_execute_tile!`. The A check covers exactly
the addresses the in-place vector loads read (the sliver's `mr` rows against
the panel's K columns); the `UnpackedAView` loads themselves are unchecked.
Allocation-free. Returns `plan.Cstorage`.

**Measured, 2026-09-25, jobs 7110225 (ccq rome/znver2, AVX2) and 7110226 (ccq
icelake-server, AVX-512), after rebasing onto the analytical blocking model
and `FMAddSubKernel` (main commits 454a5ec/bc2c917/c5254aa) -- superseding an
earlier measurement (jobs 7110151/7110152) taken under the old hand-tuned
blocking constants, since this path reads `plan.blocking` and could in
principle have shifted under the new model; it did not, materially: see
`benchmark/bench_half_packing.jl` and its `benchmark/submit_half_packing.sh`**,
sweeping K/N at `M = mr(kernel)` exactly (the only eligible shape): a real but
modest win, roughly 1.01-1.08x across most of the sweep, peaking around K=N
in the 16-256 range (up to ~1.05x Float64/AVX2, ~1.05x Float64/AVX-512,
~1.03-1.08x Float32/AVX-512) and settling to ~1.0-1.02x at K,N >= ~1024 as B's
packing/compute (which scales with N*K, unlike A's fixed `mr`-row packing cost
that scales with K alone) increasingly dominates the total. One regression
pocket: on AVX2 at the tiniest K/N (1-8), this path is 6-20% SLOWER than
`execute!` -- the eligibility check and loop setup cost more than the (tiny)
packing they avoid there; AVX-512 mostly does not show this (one noise-level
dip at Float64 K=N=4, ~0.93x). Net: worth keeping as opt-in exactly as
shipped; auto-wiring into `plan_contract`'s dispatch would
need an additional lower K/N gate to avoid the AVX2 regression pocket, which
has not been attempted here.

The measurement above used the SIMPLEST eligible fixture only: a plain,
contiguous, dense M-by-K/K-by-N matrix pair at the default kernel shape.
**Extended, 2026-09-26, jobs 7111552 (rome/AVX2) and 7111553
(icelake-server/AVX-512), same canary discipline**, to check this
generalizes, since most real multi-label tensor contractions do NOT look
like a plain two-index GEMM:

  * *Non-ramp K*: A's own rows are still unit-stride (eligible), but the K
    composite as a whole (both operands' maps together) is not one affine
    ramp -- e.g. `A[m,k1,k2]` dense against `B[k2,k1,n]` dense, same K label
    order, incompatible per-operand strides -- so the in-place A read takes
    the indexed `PtrScatterAxis` path, not a compile-time affine stride. Same
    band, 1.01-1.05x typical in the mid-range, same near-parity/slight-loss
    pocket at the tiniest K/N on AVX2 (0.93-0.96x); one noisy outlier
    (1.46x at a tiny, sub-microsecond K=16/N=8 point on AVX-512) is a
    small-sample artifact, not a new regime.
  * *Alternate register shapes*: every non-default menu shape
    (`kernel_shapes(T)`) also shows a positive 1.01-1.07x win at a
    fixed mid-range (K,N) = (128,128) -- not an artifact of one specific
    `(mr,nr,W)`.

So the modest-win/AVX2-tiny-K-regression verdict above is not an artifact of
the simplest fixture; it holds across the realistic non-ramp-K case and
every measured register shape.
