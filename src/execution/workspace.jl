# The buffers a plan executes into, kept separate from `ContractPlan` so they
# can be reused across contractions. Typing discipline: `VT` is a `where`-bound
# parameter resolved at construction (never a `Union`- or
# `AbstractVector`-typed field), and the offset buffers stay concretely
# `Vector{Int}` -- acquired as non-temporaries, so only the packed panels
# route through the allocator.

"""
    ContractWorkspace{T,VT<:AbstractVector}

Every buffer [`execute!`](@ref) and `execute_tilewise!` need, sized once at
construction (or grown by [`reserve!`](@ref)) and never (re)allocated during
execution. Built by [`plan_contract`](@ref) and held by [`ContractPlan`](@ref);
pass an existing one back as `plan_contract(...; workspace = ws)` to reuse its
buffers across contractions of different shapes.

`T` is the **storage** element type (`eltype(C)`), which is what the backend's
workspace pool is keyed by; `VT` is the vector type of the two packed macro
panels, whose element type is `real(T)` -- the same type on the real path,
`Float64`/`Float32` for a complex contraction, since every packed buffer below
the kernel boundary holds reals. The bound on `VT` is therefore only
`AbstractVector`, with the `eltype(VT) === real(T)` invariant enforced by the
inner constructor; `VT` is still a `where`-bound parameter resolved to a
concrete vector type at construction.

`VT` is `Vector{real(T)}` on the default, GC-owned, [`reserve!`](@ref)-able
path; on an explicit-allocator path it is whatever that allocator returns, and
the workspace is then scoped to that one call -- [`release!`](@ref) it and drop
it, never pass it back as `workspace = ws`.

The `tw_*` buffers belong to `execute_tilewise!`, the independent oracle, and
are allocated only under `oracle = true`. The four register-tile-sized
`tile_*` offset buffers are always allocated: the beta-only pass of both
drivers uses them, and so does the oracle's tile loop.

Field layout is an implementation detail, not part of the public interface.
