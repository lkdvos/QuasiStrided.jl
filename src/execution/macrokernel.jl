# GUARDRAIL, load-bearing (docs/decisions.md, macro-blocking Phase A
# findings): `_axis_of` returns a `Union{AffineAxis,PtrScatterAxis}`, and each
# consumer below is a `where {R<:Axis, C<:Axis}` barrier method that Julia
# specializes per concrete (R,C), so no partially-applied -- heap-boxed --
# `QSTile` is ever built. **Do not** collapse these helpers into their call
# sites, and do not let a union cross any other boundary.
# Both arms are isbits, so this Union itself needs no heap box (see
# PtrScatterAxis).

# `pack!` is pack_a!/pack_b! -- or their `unsafe_pack_a!`/`unsafe_pack_b!`
# siblings (src/packing/pack.jl) -- as a plain function, specialized on, never a
# closure; A and B differ only in which of rows/cols is the k axis, which the
# caller has already resolved. `transform` is the plan's per-operand
# `identity`/`conj` singleton.
#
# This helper is only as safe as the `pack!` it is handed: with an `unsafe_*`
# packer it performs no storage-bounds check, which is why the call sites spell
# that name out rather than hiding it behind a flag.
#
# GUARDRAIL: every argument here has its OWN bound type parameter, `transform`
# included. Leaving `TF` unbound reintroduces the Phase 2b finding-5 ~80 B/call
# dynamic dispatch, for the reason spelled out at `pack_a!` in src/microkernels/interface.jl.
# And all THREE call sites -- `_execute_nest!`'s two and `execute_tilewise!`'s
# one -- must pass the matching operand's transform: missing the third makes
# the in-tree ORACLE silently wrong for conjugated inputs.
