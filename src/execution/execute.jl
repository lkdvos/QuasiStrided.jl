    execute!(plan::ContractPlan, alpha::Number, beta::Number)

Execution phase of [`contract!`](@ref): a BLIS five-loop macro-blocking nest
over `plan.blocking` (`nc`/loop 5, `kc`/loop 4, `mc`/loop 3), packing the
whole B panel once per `(jc,pc)` and the whole A panel once per `(jc,pc,ic)`,
then running `execute_tile!` over every micro-tile of that block (loops 2/1).
`beta` applies exactly once per output element (on the first K block only;
later ones accumulate with `beta = one(T)`). Empty output is a no-op; empty K
or `alpha == 0` applies `beta` once without reading `A`/`B`. Allocation-free.
Returns `plan.Cstorage`. See [`execute_tilewise!`](@ref) for the independent
tile-by-tile oracle this is checked against.

Storage-bounds validation is done **once per macro block**, not once per
sliver or per micro-tile: each of the three operand regions a `(jc, pc, ic)`
iteration touches is validated with one [`checked_span_bounds`](@ref) call
before anything is packed or written, and the packing/micro-kernel calls
inside it then go through `unsafe_pack_a!`/`unsafe_pack_b!`/
`unsafe_execute_tile!`. The test performed is exactly the conjunction of the
per-sliver and per-tile tests (see `checked_span_bounds`), so no address the
macro-blocking pack/execute path can reach is unvalidated, and a contraction
is rejected exactly when a per-tile check would reject it; `execute_tilewise!`
runs the per-tile checked path as an independent oracle for both the values
and the rejections.

Scoped to that path deliberately: the `Qk == 0 || alpha == 0` beta-only
short-circuit above it goes to `_scale_all_of_C!`, which performs no
storage-bounds check at all (it writes through `scale_tile!`'s `@inbounds`
path, relying on the `AxisGroup`s' own construction-time validation). It is
named here only so this paragraph is not read as a claim about it.
