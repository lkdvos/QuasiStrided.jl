Cache-blocking factors keyed on the detected vector ISA

Measured constants, not a cache model: the measured grid spans only 9%/11%
best-to-worst, so a model's upside is a few percent while a mis-fitted model
can lose tens of percent. [`cache_topology`](@ref) is exposed for reporting
only. `plan_contract` rounds `mc`/`nc` to `mr`/`nr`
multiples and clamps them to the contraction's extents.

# the packed B panel is `nc*kc` elements, per (jc, pc, ic) the packed A block is
# `mc*kc`, and loop 2 (jr) is outside loop 1 (ir), so one `NR x kc` B sliver is
# reused by every A sliver of the block while those stream past it. Hence

# to one core's SMT siblings): on a shared node a single-threaded contraction
# cannot count on another core's slice. With no L3, `L3core` is 0.
#
# The `nc` bound is deliberately the whole per-core capacity (non-inclusive L3,
# as on every machine measured), not half the L3: an oversized B panel only

# once per `jc` block. Measured (bench_blocking_model.jl, 2026-09-25, jobs
# 7107932-4 on Rome/Genoa/Ice Lake-SP): `nc <= 192` costs 3-6% on every
# machine, `nc` in 768..6144 is within ~2% of the best even where the B panel
# is 8x the core's L3 share; the half-L3 bound gave Ice Lake `nc = 192`.
