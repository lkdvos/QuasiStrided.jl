# Kernel selection: which microkernel `plan_contract` builds when the caller
# does not name one.
#
# Everything is keyed on (element type `T`, method), where the method is
# `RealMethod()` for a real `T` and `PlanarMethod()` for a complex one
# (`_default_method`); `OneMMethod()` is never chosen here, only by naming the
# kernel. Per method there is
#
#   * a closed menu of `(MR, NR, W)` shapes (`kernel_shapes`), so the set of
#     compiled kernel and driver specializations stays bounded;
#   * a kernel type (`_kernel_type`), built from a menu shape by
#     `_kernel_from_shape`;
#   * a shape resolved from the detected hardware (`_derived_shape`): an
#     explicit override row, else the `MR = 2W` rule where it has been
#     validated, else a conservative fitted shape (`_fitted_shape`);
#   * two plan-time demotions: to the fitted shape when M cannot fill one
#     register tile (`_default_kernel`), and to a menu shape that keeps every
#     register sliver unit-stride in C (`_demote_for_run`).

# rule shapes, and each 1m menu contains its AVX-512 rule shape.
#
# The last three entries of each planar menu are an `MV = 1` tile at each lane
# width the package compiles, so that `_fitted_shape` finds a fitting entry for
