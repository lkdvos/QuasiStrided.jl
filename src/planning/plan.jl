    ContractPlan

Reusable, concretely typed plan from [`plan_contract`](@ref): the M/N/K
`AxisGroup`s, kernel, operand storages, effective [`Blocking`](@ref), packing
transforms and the [`ContractWorkspace`](@ref) holding every buffer
[`execute!`](@ref) needs. Field layout is not part of the public interface;
after an M/N orientation swap the `A*` fields describe the original `B`.

Plan `C[indC] = A[indA] * B[indB]` (every label in exactly two operands):
resolve the labels into M/N/K `AxisGroup`s, validate axis lengths and eltypes,
choose the kernel and blocking, and preallocate every buffer
[`execute!`](@ref) needs. Throws `ArgumentError`/`DimensionMismatch` on
invalid input.

  * Each operand's eltype is one of `Float32`, `Float64`, `ComplexF32`,
    `ComplexF64`; a complex `A` or `B` needs a complex `C`. The compute type
    `T` is `promote_type` of the three, or, for `accumulator = Float32` or
    `Float64`, that precision in the domain (real or complex) of the promoted
    type. Operands are converted to `T` on load and `alpha*AB + beta*C` is
    evaluated in `T`, rounding to `eltype(C)` once. For an `eltype(C)` of
    lower precision than `T`, a K longer than `kc` accumulates in a panel of
    `T` in the workspace, of `M * min(N, nc)` elements.
  * `kernel = nothing` picks one from the hardware profile and the extents: a
    [`SIMDKernel`](@ref) for a real `T`, a [`PlanarKernel`](@ref) for a
    complex one (an [`FMAddSubKernel`](@ref) on AVX2, and for a short M on
    AVX-512), a [`ComplexRealKernel`](@ref)/[`RealComplexKernel`](@ref) for a
    complex `T` with a real `B`/`A`. [`OneMKernel`](@ref) is used only when named.
  * Labels within the M and N composites are ordered by their stride in `C`;
    the K order follows a cost model of the two packs. For a real `T` the
    operand roles are swapped (B feeds M) when only the N side gives `C` a
    unit-stride run long enough for the kernel's register tile; the result is
    the same either way.
  * `mc`/`kc`/`nc` override the fields of `default_blocking(kernel)` (each
    `>= 1`); `mc`/`nc` are rounded up to `mr`/`nr` multiples and all three are
    clamped to the extents.
  * An operand whose register slivers would read one element per cache line,
    with the lines' other elements needed only after more lines than fit L2,
    is packed line by line (`PackSplit`); its `mc` (or `nc`) then becomes a
    whole number of line groups, up to `requested kc / kc` times the request.
  * `workspace` reuses an existing [`ContractWorkspace`](@ref) for compute
    type `T`, grown by [`reserve!`](@ref) as needed. A non-default
    TensorOperations `allocator` sizes the buffers once via `tensoralloc`,
    forbids `workspace`, and leaves [`release!`](@ref) to the caller.
  * `oracle = false` skips `execute_tilewise!`'s buffers.
  * `conjA`/`conjB` conjugate A's/B's elements (never `alpha`/`beta`) and
    compose by XOR with a view's own `conj`/`adjoint` `op`. A conjugated `C`
    is rejected.
