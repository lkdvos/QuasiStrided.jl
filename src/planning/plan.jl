    ContractPlan

Reusable plan from [`plan_contract`](@ref): resolved M/N/K `AxisGroup`s,
kernel, operand storage/base, the effective [`Blocking`](@ref), and the
[`ContractWorkspace`](@ref) holding every buffer
[`execute!`](@ref)/[`execute_tilewise!`](@ref) need -- sized once during
planning, never (re)allocated during execution, plus the per-operand packing
transforms `atransform`/`btransform`. `VT` is the workspace's packed-panel
vector type (`Vector{real(T)}` on the default allocator path, so `Vector{T}`
on the real path), a `where`-bound parameter resolved at construction, so
every plan instance is concretely typed. Field layout is an implementation
detail, not part of the frozen interface.

Note the M/N orientation swap:
after a swap, `Astorage`/`Abase`/`atransform` describe the ORIGINAL `B`
operand and `Bstorage`/`Bbase`/`btransform` describe the original `A`, so
`plan.Astorage === parent(A)` does not hold in general -- do not assume the
field name still tracks the user-facing argument it is named after.

`kernel = nothing` (the default) resolves the kernel *after* the M/N/K groups
are built, via `_default_kernel(T, Qm, Qn)`, because the extent-aware demotion
needs `Qm`. For a real element type that is a [`SIMDKernel`](@ref) at the
hardware-derived shape; for a complex one a [`PlanarKernel`](@ref) at the
measured shape on AVX-512, and at a shape fitted to the register file
elsewhere (see src/planning/kernel_selection.jl). Pass `kernel` explicitly to
override. [`OneMKernel`](@ref) is never selected automatically; naming it is
the only way to use 1m.

Planning phase of [`contract!`](@ref): resolves labels into M/N/K
`AxisGroup`s, validates matched axis lengths and eltypes, and preallocates
every buffer [`execute!`](@ref) needs.

Label order and orientation: the
labels inside the M composite (A's free labels) and the N composite (B's free
labels) are each stable-sorted by `abs(stride)` of the label's axis *in `C`*,
ascending, ties keeping the operand's own axis order -- so each composite is
enumerated with `C`'s fastest axis fastest, whatever A's or B's layout is. The
K composite keeps `indA` order. Then, if the sorted M list does *not* begin
with a unit-stride run of at least `mr(kernel)` elements in `C` while the sorted
N list does, the operand roles are swapped: `B` feeds M and `A` feeds N, and
the K maps, the storage/base fields and the conjugation transforms move with
them (so `plan.Astorage` may be `parent(B)`). The result is unchanged either
way; only the walk through `C` is. `mc`/`kc`/`nc` are the macro-blocking
factors (see [`Blocking`](@ref)); a `nothing` keyword takes the corresponding
field of `default_blocking(kernel)`. Each must be `>= 1`, and is then rounded
and clamped into the *effective* blocking stored on the plan: `mc`/`nc` round
up to a whole `mr(kernel)`/`nr(kernel)` multiple, then cap at the M/N extent
(likewise rounded up); `kc` caps at the K extent. Throws
`ArgumentError`/`DimensionMismatch` on invalid input.

Buffers:

  * `workspace = nothing` builds a fresh [`ContractWorkspace`](@ref); passing
    an existing one reuses it, grown as needed by [`reserve!`](@ref), even
    across differently shaped contractions.
  * `allocator` is a TensorOperations allocator. `DefaultAllocator` gives a
    plain, GC-owned, `reserve!`-able `ContractWorkspace{T,Vector{T}}`; any
    other one sizes the packed panels exactly once via
    `TensorOperations.tensoralloc`, forbids `workspace` as well, and leaves
    [`release!`](@ref) to the caller.
  * `oracle = false` skips `execute_tilewise!`'s own buffers entirely, making
    that oracle unavailable for this plan. `execute!` is unaffected.

Conjugation: `conjA`/`conjB` request `conj` on A's/B's elements, TensorOperations'
semantics (`alpha`/`beta` are never conjugated). Each flag is folded here with
the corresponding view's `op` -- they compose with XOR, so a `conj`-wrapped view
with `conjA = true` is unconjugated -- and the result is stored on the plan as a
singleton transform applied during packing. A conjugated *output* view is
rejected: the engine addresses `parent(C)` directly and would silently ignore
it. For a real element type both transforms are `identity` no matter what the
flags say, so the real path gains no specialization.
