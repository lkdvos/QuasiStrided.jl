# Planar (split-complex, BLIS "1r") microkernel: the default complex method.
#
# Both packed panels hold `[re_0 .. re_{n-1} | im_0 .. im_{n-1}]` per logical K
# step (`PlanarFormat`), so the data is already in the right lanes and the body
# is four real FMAs per (A-vector, B-scalar) pair -- no shuffles, no `fmaddsub`,
# no duplicated lanes. Everything below this boundary works exclusively in
# `real(T)`: packed buffers, `SIMD.Vec` lanes and the accumulator.
#
# Two *independent* performance cliffs run through this file and must not be
# conflated (docs/decisions.md, "The planar microkernel: accumulator, body, and
# two independent cliffs"):
#
#   Cliff A -- architectural register spill. Hardware. See
#   `planar_register_pressure`.
#
#   Cliff B -- Julia's tuple lowering. Dynamic `NTuple` indexing above NV = 16
#   makes the compiler heap-allocate the accumulator: 24576 B per `execute!`,
#   measured in Phase H. Planar at 16x6 is NV_total = 24, so the cliff is live
#   from the first line of code. Therefore *every* accumulate and store here is
#   `@generated` with literal tuple indices, including the lane tail -- the real
#   path's runtime-indexed `_acc_lane` helper (src/kernels/simd.jl) must not be
#   used here.

Split-complex microkernel over `SIMD.Vec{W,real(T)}` lanes, implementing
[`PlanarMethod`](@ref). `MR`/`NR` are the **logical** (complex) register-tile
extents and `T` is the **storage** element type (`ComplexF32`/`ComplexF64`);
`W` is the lane count of the *real* type, and `MR` must be a multiple of it
(checked at construction). `NR` need not be — B contributes one complex scalar
per column per K step.

The field is named `descriptor`, so `mr`/`nr`/`scalartype`/`packed_a_length`/
`packed_b_length`/`realtype`/`packed_a_per_k` all forward through the existing
`DescriptorKernel` methods in src/kernel.jl and src/complex_format.jl; this
kernel adds no forwarding of its own beyond the two plane-offset accessors.

The 3-argument form defaults `W` via `_default_lanewidth(real(T))`.

# Vectorized unit-stride store fast path (Phase 2 of
# docs/proposals/complex-fast-paths.md, Section 3.3)
#
# The mirror image of the complex PACK fast path (src/packing.jl, Phase 1):
# packing deinterleaves `Complex{T}`'s native `[re,im,re,im,...]` layout into
# two planes, and this interleaves two planes back into it. Unlike packing,
# this also has to do real arithmetic -- `alpha*r + beta*C_old` with COMPLEX
# `alpha`/`beta`, which mixes the two planes -- so the whole of the difficulty
# is in reproducing that arithmetic, not in the data movement.
#
# ARITHMETIC: this reproduces the expression tree Base's own `Complex`
# arithmetic specifies -- the same tree `_axpby_tile!` reaches through --
# operand for operand, with the scalars broadcast to `Vec`. Section 3.3 of the
# proposal suggested reusing `_accumulate_step_planar`'s four-real-FMA
# grouping instead; that would have been *a* correct grouping, but a
# deliberately different one, and there is no reason to accept a second
# grouping when the scalar path's own is expressible verbatim in lanes.
#
# The three `beta` regimes, identical to `_axpby_tile!`'s:
#
#   beta == 0   alpha * r
#               = Complex(ar*rr - ai*ri, ar*ri + ai*rr)        (Base `*`,
#                 four UNFUSED multiplies; Julia does not set LLVM's `contract`
#                 flag, so `ar*rr - ai*ri` stays two `vmul` + one `vsub` in
#                 both the scalar and the vector form -- the same fact the
#                 `_accumulate_step_planar` guardrail above relies on, used
#                 here to preserve rounding rather than to avoid losing it.)
#   beta == 1   muladd(alpha, r, C_old)
#   otherwise   muladd(alpha, r, beta * C_old)
#
#               with Base's `muladd(z,w,x)` =
#                 Complex(muladd(zr, wr, -muladd(zi, wi, -xr)),
#                         muladd(zr, wi, muladd(zi, wr, xi)))
#
# HOW CLOSE THE TWO PATHS ACTUALLY AGREE, measured rather than assumed
# (16205 elements over every shipped shape, both dtypes, seven alpha/beta
# regimes; test/test_planar_store_fastpath.jl re-runs the measurement):
#
#   * Every VECTORIZED FULL BLOCK is bit-exact to the tree above -- zero
#     misses against an independently written, optimization-barriered
#     transcription of it, compared with `isequal` so `-0.0` and NaN payloads
#     count. `SIMD.Vec`'s `*`/`-` carry no LLVM `contract` flag, so the lanes
#     round exactly where the source text says they do.
#   * Against `_store_tile_planar!` the agreement is exact at `beta == 0` and
#     `beta == 1`, and ~1 ULP in the general-`beta` regime. The variability is
#     on the SCALAR side, not this one: LLVM SLP-vectorizes Base's
#     `muladd(::Complex, ::Complex, ::Complex)` into `<2 x double>` ops and
#     marks them `contract` (plainly visible in `@code_llvm` of
#     `muladd(a, r, b*c)` at `ComplexF64`: `fmul contract` / `fsub contract`),
#     letting the backend fuse a multiply the source text rounds separately.
#     Whether it fires depends on inlining context, so the scalar path is not
#     bit-reproducible even against ITSELF across call sites -- measured: 6 of
#     the 16205 elements differ between this function's own scalar row tail and
#     `_store_tile_planar!`, running character-identical source. Requiring the
#     fast path to match it bitwise would be requiring it to match an LLVM
#     heuristic. This is the situation the proposal's Section 6.4 anticipated
#     ("compare with a tolerance, never `==`"), with the cause now identified.
#
# The `beta` regimes are the SAME three `_axpby_tile!` has, chosen by the same
# `iszero`/`isone` tests on the same per-call scalar: the beta-applied-once
# contract (src/kernel.jl's `_store_prologue!`/`_axpby_tile!`) is untouched,
# and in particular `beta == 0` never loads the destination here either.
#
# NOT an `unsafe_` path: it skips no validation a caller would otherwise get.
# `_store_prologue!` runs first and unchanged, the `(v+1)*W <= m` test keeps
# every straddling row-vector on the scalar tail exactly as the real path's
# `_store_tile_vector!` does, and `j < n` keeps padding columns unwritten -- so
# the set of addresses touched is exactly the set `_store_tile_planar!` would
# have touched.

    _complex_vector_eligible(tile::QSTile, ::Type{T}) -> Bool

Whether `tile` can take a vectorized complex store/load: unit-stride
`AffineAxis` rows into rank-1 dense `Complex` storage, on an ISA this ships
for. The complex counterpart of [`_vector_store_eligible`](@ref)
(src/kernels/simd.jl) and, per the proposal's Section 5, deliberately ONE
predicate -- the same shape question asked of a destination tile here and
(through `_pack_complex_contiguous_eligible`'s clauses) of a source tile in
src/packing.jl, sharing the ISA half literally via
`_complex_fastpath_isa_eligible`.

Unit stride plus rank-1 dense storage is what makes `reinterpret`ing the
storage pointer from `Ptr{Complex{R}}` to `Ptr{R}` a sound bitcast: `W`
consecutive rows are then `W` consecutive `Complex{R}` values and hence `2W`
consecutive `R`s. It is unsound for a `ScatterAxis`/`PtrScatterAxis` row, for
a strided `AffineAxis`, and for non-`DenseArray` storage, and all three are
excluded here (proposal Section 3.3).

The storage clause inspects types only, so at each specialization the whole
predicate folds to `_unit_stride_rows(tile.rows) && <isa check>` or to `false`.

"""
    store_tile!(destination::QSTile, acc::NTuple{2NV,SIMD.Vec{W,real(T)}}, alpha::T, beta::T, kernel::PlanarKernel) -> destination

Planar counterpart of `SIMDKernel`'s `store_tile!`, with the **same contract**:
`C[i,j] = alpha*R[i,j] + beta*C[i,j]` over the valid rectangle only;
`alpha == 0` never reads `acc`; `beta == 0` never reads old `C`; `beta == 1`
skips the multiplication; padding lanes (`i >= m`, `j >= n`) are never read, so
nonfinite padding in `acc` cannot propagate; an empty destination is a no-op in
every branch.

Two paths, chosen by [`_complex_vector_eligible`](@ref):

  * Fast path, `_store_tile_planar_vector!`: unit-stride `AffineAxis` rows into
    rank-1 dense `Complex` storage on a shipped ISA. Whole `W`-row blocks get
    one `2W`-real load (only when `beta != 0`), a plane-wise complex multiply-
    add, an interleave shuffle and one `2W`-real store; a straddling row-vector
    falls to the scalar tail.
  * Fallback, `_store_tile_planar!`: everything else -- scattered or strided
    rows, non-dense storage, an un-shipped ISA. Recombines
    `Complex(re[lane], im[lane])` and delegates to the generic `_axpby_tile!`
    (src/kernel.jl), which provides the `beta` shortcuts.

The fast path is bitwise identical (`isequal`, so `-0.0`/NaN payloads count)
to a from-scratch, optimization-barriered transcription of the expression
tree documented above this function's implementation. Against the fallback
specifically, it is exact at `beta == 0` and `beta == 1`, and within ~1 ULP
in the general-`beta` regime -- the fallback itself is not bit-reproducible
against ITSELF across call sites there (LLVM inconsistently fuses Base's
`muladd(::Complex,::Complex,::Complex)`; see the divergence measurement
above). Compare the general-`beta` case with a tolerance, never `==`.
