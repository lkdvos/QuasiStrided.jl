# A contraction C[indC] = alpha * A[indA] * B[indB] + beta * C runs through the
# stages below, in order. `plan_contract` resolves labels into M/N/K axis
# groups, picks a microkernel and cache blocking, and sizes a workspace;
# `execute!` runs a BLIS five-loop nest that packs A/B slivers into panels and
# drives the microkernel over register tiles of C.
#
# Include order follows type dependencies, which mostly coincide with the
# stage order; the exceptions are noted inline.
