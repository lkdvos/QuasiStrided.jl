# Per-call-floor milestone (docs/decisions.md, "Per-call floor: cheaper
# planning, once-per-block bounds validation, closed-form affine blocks").
#
# Three things are pinned here, each of which the rest of the suite would only
# catch indirectly:
#
#   1. the rewritten planning helpers (`_classify_labels`, `_order_free_labels`,
#      `_build_pair_group`) against straightforward reference implementations,
#   2. the once-per-macro-block storage-bounds check: that it still REJECTS
#      what the per-sliver checks rejected, that it accepts exactly what they
#      accepted, and that the check really did move (counted, not assumed),
#   3. `affine_ramp` and the closed-form block description built on it, against
#      the buffer-materializing path it replaces -- descriptor by descriptor.
