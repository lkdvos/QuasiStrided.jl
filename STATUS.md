# QuasiStrided.jl status

Durable status record for the main orchestration process. Update at phase
boundaries or before context compaction. History belongs here only as far as
"what phase are we in"; do not let this rot into a changelog — narrative
detail belongs in `docs/decisions.md`.

## Integrated revision

Local git repo at `/mnt/home/ldevos/Projects/QuasiStrided.jl`, `main` branch,
HEAD `5d50a53` ("Phase 4: review since Phase 2b, close 2 coverage gaps,
driver benchmarks"). No remote; not published, registered, or pushed, per
handoff §2/§8.

## Environment

- Julia 1.12.6. `StridedViews` v0.5.1/0.5.2 and `SIMD.jl` v3.7.2 resolvable
  locally (declared deps); `Strided` v2.6.3/2.6.4 resolvable (test-only dep).
- Reference machine: Xeon Gold 6244, Cascade Lake, AVX-512(f/dq/cd/bw/vl) +
  AVX2 + FMA. All measurements in this project were taken on this one
  machine — no cross-microarchitecture claim is made anywhere.

## Phase status — all complete

- [x] **Phase 0** (bootstrap/freeze): package skeleton, `contract!` signature
      frozen, SIMD dependency chosen.
- [x] **Phase 1** (indexing + independent oracle): `AxisGroup`/`offsets`/
      `fill_offsets!`/`BlockDescriptor`/`normalize_group`, independent
      `CartesianIndices` oracle, real `StridedView` integration.
- [x] **Phase 2** (tiles/packing/scalar kernel): `AffineAxis`/`ScatterAxis`/
      `QSTile`, `pack_a!`/`pack_b!`, `ScalarKernel`. Two integration
      reconciliations (destination-tile type drift, kernel/packing coupling).
- [x] **Phase 2b** (Fable review): 2 blocking findings (missing storage-bounds
      checks before `@inbounds` hot paths) fixed and regression-tested; 1
      allocation finding deferred (not correctness-affecting).
      `fable_review_used: true` — spent, do not relaunch.
- [x] **Phase 3** (SIMD + serial driver): `SIMDKernel` (register-resident,
      `@code_llvm`-verified, 3.9-6.3x vs scalar single-tile), `contract!`/
      `plan_contract`/`execute!` driver (label resolution, output tiling,
      multi-K-panel, beta applied once). Both workers converged on the same
      integration pattern independently — `SIMDKernel` is a drop-in `kernel=`
      swap in the driver with zero driver changes needed, verified.
- [x] **Phase 4** (review + measurement + handoff): Sonnet-High review of
      everything since Phase 2b — no blocking findings; 2 coverage gaps
      closed (SIMDKernel-through-driver allocation test, dangling-in-B label
      test). Driver-level benchmark taken (planning vs. steady-state
      execution cost). README.md finished. This file is the closing record.

**Final test count: `Pkg.test("QuasiStrided")` → 12627/12627 passing.**

Full narrative for every decision, integration reconciliation, and review
disposition is in `docs/decisions.md` — that file, not this one, is
authoritative for *why*. This file is only *what phase, what count*.

## What works, measured

- Correctness: full test suite green, including an independent oracle
  (Phase 1), real `StridedView` integration (permuted/sliced/negative-stride/
  zero-stride), two independent review passes, and scalar-vs-SIMD numerical
  agreement (`atol=1e-8`–`1e-10`, not bitwise — expected, documented).
- Performance, single machine only: scalar and SIMD kernels are
  zero-steady-state-allocation and (SIMD) register-resident, confirmed by
  `@allocated`/`@code_llvm` inspection, not assumed from source-level tuples.
  SIMD is 3.9-6.3x faster than scalar at the single-tile level (kc 1-256) and
  faster-with-lower-allocation through the full driver on a 64×64×64 case.
  Driver planning cost (~4.4-6.7 µs/call) is under 3% of execution cost at
  that size and fully amortizable across a reused plan.

## What's known and unresolved

- `pack_a!`/`pack_b!` allocate ~80 B/call in steady state; root cause not
  isolated (three individually-zero-allocating sub-pieces measured, but the
  full function body still allocates). Not a correctness issue. This is the
  one open item a future session should pick up first if continuing
  performance work — see `docs/decisions.md`'s Phase 2b disposition (finding
  5) for what was already ruled out.
- No cache-blocked macro-kernel, autotuning, threading, or GPU path — all
  explicitly deferred per the handoff, not gaps in this milestone's scope.

## Next task

None outstanding for this milestone. A future session extending this work
should start by reading `docs/decisions.md` in full (it is the frozen-
interface and disposition record every subsequent change must respect), then
`docs/decisions.md`'s Phase 2b finding 5 (the deferred allocation) if
continuing performance work, or the two specs' "Deferred work"/"Deferred
extensions" sections if extending scope.
